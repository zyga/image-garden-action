## Problem

The `spread-subdir` input parameter is not working correctly. The action attempts to change directory using `cd` in step "Enter project subdirectory" (lines 68-71 in action.yaml), but this doesn't persist across subsequent steps in composite actions.

As a result, when the spread command runs (line 166), it executes in the root directory rather than the specified subdirectory, causing the error:

```
error: cannot load project file from .: cannot find spread.yaml or .spread.yaml
```

## Failed Job

This issue was observed in: https://github.com/zyga/image-garden-action/actions/runs/21083162793/job/60641249380

## Root Cause

In GitHub Actions composite actions, each `run` step executes in a separate shell. Running `cd` in one step doesn't affect the working directory of subsequent steps.

## Solution

Instead of using `cd` in a separate step, all steps that need to operate in the subdirectory should use the `working-directory` parameter. This includes:

- Cache-related steps (lines 72-91)
- The "Restore mtime" step (lines 92-106)
- The "Make the virtual machine image" steps (lines 138-156)
- The "Rebase" step (lines 157-162)
- **The "Run integration tests" step (lines 163-166)** - most critical

## Recommended Fix

Remove the "Enter project subdirectory" step and add `working-directory: ${{ inputs.spread-subdir }}` to all relevant steps, particularly:

```yaml
- name: Run integration tests
  shell: bash
  working-directory: ${{ inputs.spread-subdir }}
  run: |
    spread ${{ inputs.spread-artifacts && format('-artifacts {0}', inputs.spread-artifacts) || '' }} -v ${{ inputs.spread-backend }}:${{ inputs.garden-system }}:${{ inputs.spread-tasks }}
```

The same pattern should be applied to other steps that need to work with files in the subdirectory.
